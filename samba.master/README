Do something like the following:

./autogen.sh
./configure --with-samba-source=../../samba.master/source3/
make

Of course, you might have to change the name of your Samba source tree.

Also, note that there is a small difference between the Makefile.in here and
the current master branch. This Makefile will really only run on systems with
GNUmake.
